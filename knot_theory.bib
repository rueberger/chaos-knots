@article{chaoticknots,
abstract = {The delicate interplay between knot theory and dynamical systems is surveyed. Numerous bridges between these fields allow us to apply dynamical perspectives (entropy, ‘chaotic’) to knot theory, as well as knot-theoretic perspectives (cablings, ‘wild’) to dynamical phenomena and bifurcations thereof. This intricate relationship has opened new doors in the study of ODE models of physical systems, while conversely yielding interesting topological objects from dynamical flows},

abstract = {We consider knotted periodic orbits in the “natural” suspension of Smale's horseshoe map as constructed by Holmes and Williams (1985) and Holmes (1986). We identify quartets and octets of periodic orbits which are isotopic knots and indicate how they are related via the sequences of bifurcations in which they are created in two-parameter families such as the H{\'{e}}non map.},
